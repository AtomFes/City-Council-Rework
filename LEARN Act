 

Local Education and Academics for Reformation and Newcomers Act
Mayoral Legislation of Los Santos

Purpose:

The Mayor’s Office wishes to establish an education path for the Citizens of Los Santos, with the appointment of a Dean of Education to facilitate potential teachers. The Dean will help educators with any type of location or resource to complete their schooling.

Guidelines:

The Dean of Education will set their expectations, examinations, and interviews for educators. The Mayor’s Office only requires that the Dean and their educators are non-violent felons. The Mayor’s Office will establish a baseline fund for the Education Department to make sure educators are properly paid for their time on top of the class fees. Lastly, the CLL program brought from the License Overhaul Legislation Act will be moved to the Education Department once a Dean is selected.
