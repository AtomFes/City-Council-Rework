 

Taking Animals Conscientiously without Overharvesting
Mayoral Legislation of Los Santos

Proposal : 

To establish a defined set of boundaries as to what is acceptable while recreationally or commercially hunting in Los Santos. To establish safety equipment and weapons regulations and limitations and to establish clearly defined bag limits for any given hunting session.  

Articles :

1.	Any persons hunting recreationally or commercially are required to have an up to date and valid hunting license as well as a weapons license.
2.	Legal and defined hunting grounds. Hunting shall only be allowed in specified areas. Taking game outside of said areas is prohibited and can lead to prosecution. While hunting these areas are defined on your hunting map and are color coded in red and blue. Hunting outside of these areas will be considered illegal and violators will be prosecuted. Your hunting license may be subject to revocation in violation of this decree.
3.	  While hunting, all participants present are required to wear high visibility clothing on the upper portion of their body in either bright yellow or orange. 
4.	Hunting will be limited to the use of weapons specifically designed for hunting. The hunting rifle is currently the only acceptable option. Hunting with licensed legal handguns or any illegal firearms will not be acceptable and will lead to prosecution.
5.	Harvesting animals killed by motor vehicles or any handheld weapon is also prohibited. All game must be taken ethically with a hunting rifle and harvested professionally. 
6.	Bag Limits for any given session of hunting will be 80 units of unprocessed game meat. Having more than 80 units on your person or in your hunting vehicle or the 2 combined will be considered a violation and the person(s) in violation will be issued a citation based on how over you are. Exceeding by up to 10 units would be a citation. Exceeding by up to 19 units would be a higher fine citation. Exceeding by more than 20 units will lead to a misdemeanor charge.
7.	Any of the above violations that result in a license revocation will result in a mandatory 7 day waiting period before you can re-apply for a hunting license. Before obtaining your hunting license you will need to attend a hunter safety course which will be formed after approval of this legislation and overseen by the City Council.
8.	All individual participants in hunting, defined as (a) being in a hunting area, and, (b) utilizing a weapon, whether correct or incorrect, to hunt animals, shall be subject to bag limit inspections as defined in Article 6. Law Enforcement of San Andreas, regardless of any department, conducts these searches.

Reason for Legislation : 

This legislation is being proposed in order to introduce legislation to protect and sustain the wildlife populations of Los Santos by introducing guidelines for safe and ethical harvesting of game meat. It is also intended to establish proper safety guidelines and standards of conduct while hunting and introducing repercussions for non-compliance. 

Business Exemption List:
Certain businesses within the City may employ citizens as registered commercial hunters. These commercial hunters are exempt only from the Bag Limit, wherein they would be subject to a limit of 160 units of unprocessed meat. Anything exceeding this amount while operating as a commercial hunter will immediately be subject to the misdemeanor hunting charge. This will also be updated with new businesses as they come to the Mayor's office and apply for this exemption.
